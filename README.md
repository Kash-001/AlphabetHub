This was originally made for any roblox game, using your keyboard to materialize letters up your head.
The method used to mesh the hats is now discontinued, so feel free to remplace it so that works, because hats positionning still works fine.

***how to use ?***<br>
First equip those hats :

- Pal Hair
- LavanderHair
- Pink Hair
- Robloxclassicred
- Kate Hair

Also get any community made head accessory

***Controls***<br>
As said before, use your keyboard to synthetize letters, Q R S T V W X Y Z have to be made if you want to use them.
